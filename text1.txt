Where there's a will, there's a way, kind of beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical
And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable
With something to believe in 3 days
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hoping
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars, it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around
We are one of a kind, irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hoping
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars, it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around
Once upon 2002 a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play party 69
Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade
One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say
"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid" can you sing 11 0
He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
"When thunderclouds start pouring down
Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars"
He said, "Go venture far beyond the shores
Don't forsake this life of yours
I'll guide you home no matter where you are"
One day, my father, he told me, "Son, don't let it slip away"
When I was just a kid, I heard him say
"When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid"
He said, "One day, you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember"
My father told me when I was just a child
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
"These are the nights that never die"
My father told me
My father told me
You say you only ever wanted love
As my hand falls from your face
Your tears are showing me you're giving up
And you start to walk away
I said, "Hold on, darling, it's harder to breathe"
As I reach for your hand while you're turning to leave
Now I know that it's over between you and me
I hope that you find all that you want
I wasted moments that I can't get back
For something special that I thought we had
It took too long but now I know
I guess you never really loved me at all
I guess you never really loved me at all
(I guess you never really loved me at all)
I guess you never really loved me at all
I guess you never really loved me at, at, at, at all
There's so much good that lies in front of me
Sometimes the start is the end
Just like the summer steals the memories
Oh, it's warming me up again
I said, "Hold on, darling, it's harder to breathe"
As I reach for your hand while you're turning to leave
Now I know that it's over between you and me
I hope that you find all that you want
I wasted moments that I can't get back
For something special that I thought we had
It took too long but now I know
I guess you never really loved me at all
I shoulda listened when my mother said
All that my heart would do is wreck my head
It took too long but now I know
I guess you never really loved me at all
I guess you never really loved me at all
(I guess you never really loved me at all)
I guess you never really loved me at, at, at, at all
I will always remember
The day you kissed my lips
Light as a feather
And it went just like this
No, it's never been better
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
Uh, we were only eleven
But acting like grown-ups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
Well, I guess that was true
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
Yeah
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
And it went like this, say
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young, uh
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
On an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oh, now
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
On the day we fell in love, love, love
